Favorite View Example
======

Description
-----
The Favoriate View is a very simple view example. It demonstrates the very basics of how
to write and expose a REST service which works with instance parameters and instance data.

Package
-----
All views are packaged as a view archive. The view archive contains the configuration
file and various optional components of the view.
