  <!-- The properties that end in tar_source describe the pattern of where the tar.gz files come from.
  They will replace {{ hdp_stack_version }} with the rpm_version value followed by -* (which is the build number in HDP 2.2),
  and treat {{ component_version }} as a wildcard.
  When copying those tarballs, Ambari will look up the corresponding tar_destination_folder property to know where it
  should be copied to.
  All of the destination folders must begin with hdfs://
  Please note that the spaces inside of {{ ... }} are important.
