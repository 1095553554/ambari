Command Line Interface

  Ambari Client implements a convenient command line interface for administrators to 
  manage the full life of Hadoop clusters. CLI is a thin client implemented using 
  Ambari REST APIs. By design, there is a close mapping between CLI and REST APIs, where
  most of the logic is implemented in the REST API. 

  []

  General syntax of the CLI command is as follows, 

  * Ambari commands are divided into multiple command categories typically named after 
  the resources them operate on e.g. cluster, node, blueprint etc.

  * Each command starts with command category followed by one of the commands in that category, 
  followed by one or more options available for the command e.g.

    * ambari \[command_category\] \[command_name\] \[command_options\]

  * Command options can follow in any order. Options are prefixed with "-". 

  * Each option would have at most one value associated with it. Value is either a string e.g. -name "MyCluster"
  or a key=value pair e.g. -role rolename="hostname1, hostname[10-20]"

  * Certain command options can be repeated multiple times on the command line, they are marked accordingly
  using tag <<[REPEATABLE]>>. 

  * All the required options are marked as <<[REQUIRED]>>

  * Generic commands do not have any category associated with them e.g. help, version

    * blueprint \{list | history | add | get\}

  * <<Node commands>>

    * nodes \{node | list | get\}

  * <<Generic commands>>

    * help

    * version


Cluster Commands

  * <<cluster  create>> 

    * It submits the cluster creation request to Ambari. It may take some time to bring 
    the cluster to the desired state and hence the state should be checked either through list command or user
    can optionally wait for cluster to reach the desired goal state. 

    * <<Options:>>

      * <<-name>> [ NAME ] <<[REQUIRED]>>

      * <<-blueprint>> [ BLUEPRINT NAME ]  <<[REQUIRED]>>

        * Name of the user defined blueprint defining cluster configuration

      * <<-blueprint_revision>> [ BLUEPRINT REVISION ] <<[REQUIRED]>>

        * Revision of the blueprint. If not specified latest one is used.

      * <<-nodes>> [node_range_exp1, node_range_exp2]  <<[REQUIRED]>>

        * Specify range of nodes associated with the cluster. One or more node range expressions can be specified
        separated by comma. If user has not explicitly specified role to nodes association using -role option then
        Ambari will assign the role(s) to nodes based on node attributes. If user wants to view the role to nodes 
        association generated by Ambari, use -dry_run option

      * <<-desc>> [ DESCRIPTION ]

        * Ambari will add default description

      * <<-goalstate>> [ACTIVE]

        * Default is INACTIVE

      * <<-services>> [component-1, component-2, component-3]

        * By default all the components will be activated upon cluster activation. 
        If user specifies specific ones then only they will be activated upon cluster activation

      * <<-role>>  rolename=[node_range_exp1, node_range_exp2, …] <<[REPEATABLE]>>

        * One or more -role options can be used to specify the association of nodes to various roles. Nodes not 
        explicitly associated with any role will be associated with various roles based on node attributes.

      * <<-dry_run>>

        * Execute the command without actually making the changes effective. 

      * <<-wait>>

        * Optionally wait for cluster to get to goal state

  []

  * <<cluster update>> 

    * It updates the cluster definition. All the options except name are OPTIONAL

    * <<Options:>>

      * <<-name>>  [ NAME ] <<[REQUIRED]>>

        * Specify the list of desired active components 

      * <<-nodes>>  [node_range_exp1, node_range_exp2]

        * Specify range of nodes associated with cluster. Ambari controller will figure out the 
        changes and accordingly allocate/deallocate the nodes.

      * <<-role>>  rolename=[node_exp1, node_exp2, …]  <<[REPEATABLE]>>

        * Ambari controller will figure out the changes and accordingly allocate/deallocate the nodes 
        associated with the role

        * This will show the details of the changes being made to cluster definition without actually 
        submitting them to Ambari controller
